# Car_Price_Predictor_Machine_Learning_Project
In This Project I Built a Car Price Predictor Model Using Linear Regression Machine Learning Model.
steps Applied From Start:
1. Import Basic Library
2. Load Dataset
3. Domain analysis & Basics checks
4. Checking for missiong values 
5. checking the distribution of categorical data 
6. encoding categorical data into numbers 
7. Finding car age from current date 
8. exploratory data anaysis
9. Handling Outliers using IQR method
10. Feature Engineering 
11. Finding correlation between various columns
12. splitting Data into X & Y
13. Splitting The Dataset Into The Training Set And Test Set
14. Model Building
15. saving new model
16. & last prediction of data using new built model 
17. created gui interface for car price predictor
Done with project
